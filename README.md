# sentiment-analysis
This Project is focus on sentiment classification of a large set of products reviews provided
by Yelp.
The goal of the project is developing some sentiment classification models by machine
learning algorithms that can classifying the texts to the five levels of polarity of opinion as
accurately as possible. Each text is labelled with one of the five sentiment labels which are
strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive.
After trying different models including Naive Bayes, Classification Tree and SVM model, we find out that SVM model has the best perform that has 63% accuarcy on May, 2019. This task will be trained to get more better perform later
